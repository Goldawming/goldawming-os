# Goldawming OS

Goldawming OS is a human-directed, AI-operated engineering system.

This repository documents:
- a governance-first model for AI usage
- explicit human responsibility
- a real, working Cognitive Companion (MVP-1)

AI is not hidden here.
It is constrained, audited, and subordinated by design.
