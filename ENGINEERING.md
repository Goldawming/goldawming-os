# Goldawming OS
## Human-Directed, AI-Operated Engineering System

Goldawming OS defines an explicit operational model for using AI in real engineering without losing human responsibility, judgment, or accountability.

AI is treated as a subordinate cognitive operator.
Humans retain authority, validation, and ethical responsibility.
