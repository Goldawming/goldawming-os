# Operator Model
## The Human Role in Goldawming OS

## 1. Definition

The operator is the system’s center of gravity.

Nothing happens without:
- human intent
- human validation
- human acceptance

---

## 2. Non-Negotiable Responsibilities

The operator:
- defines objectives
- provides real context
- executes real tests
- validates results
- accepts or rejects outputs
- assumes consequences

AI never owns responsibility.

---

## 3. What the Operator Does Not Do

- does not delegate critical judgment
- does not accept output blindly
- does not hide AI usage
- does not outsource accountability

---

## 4. Relationship With AI

AI is:
- a cognitive tool
- an analytical accelerator
- a generation assistant
- an exhaustive documenter

Never an authority.

---

## 5. Operational Ethics

If something is technically possible but humanly wrong,
the operator stops it.

This is not a bug.
It is a feature.

---

## 6. Signature Requirement

Every critical module must include:

Operator:
Decision Context:
Validated: yes/no
Date:

Without this, it is invalid.

---

## 7. What This Creates

Not faster developers.

But:
- conscious engineers
- defensible systems
- explainable code
- auditable decisions

---

## Closing

You are not trying to “use AI better”.

You are answering a harder question:

**How do we remain human in increasingly automated systems?**
